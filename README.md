This contains several functions for modeling propegation of sound based on point sources of sound and walls with certain sound transmission classes. This also contains several helper functions which are helpful for this task, but also helpful for general acoustics problems, such as SPL_add which adds an array of dbSPLs, SPL_decay, which calculates the dBSPL of a sound source after a certain amount of distance, and several others. I encourage you to open the functions to read how they are meant to be used.
